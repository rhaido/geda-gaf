----------------------------------
Done processing.  Work performed:
board.pcb is backed up as board.pcb.bak.
2 elements deleted from board.pcb.
1 file elements and 0 m4 elements added to board.new.pcb.
3 components had no footprint attribute and are omitted.
4 elements had a value change in board.pcb.

Next steps:
1.  Run pcb on your file board.pcb.
2.  From within PCB, select "File -> Load layout data to paste buffer"
    and select board.new.pcb to load the new footprints into your existing layout.
3.  From within PCB, select "File -> Load netlist file" and select 
    board.net to load the updated netlist.

4.  From within PCB, enter

           :ExecuteFile(board.cmd)

    to update the pin names of all footprints.
